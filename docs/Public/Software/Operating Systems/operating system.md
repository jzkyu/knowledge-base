An *operating system* (OS) is an interface between the user and the computer hardware. This interface manages the basic software and hardware resources of a computer, to allow other software / hardware to interact with the computer's hardware. Examples include [[memory]] management, process management, and handling input / output [[device]]. [^1] 

When the computer boots up, the operating system is the first thing it loads, in particular the [[kernel]].
