*Debugging* is the processes of fixing problems in the code.

Programmers spend a lot of time *debugging*, almost 50% of the time. 

There isn't really an established method for teaching *debugging* and problem solving. Experience can't really be taught. 

The MINS problem solving model works like this:
- Make a mental model
	- What is the intended behavior of the system
	- Flowcharts are a great way to plan a program or function
- Identify inconsistencies
	- What is the actual behavior of the program? 
- Narrow the problem scope
	- Interpret inconsistencies to figure out the bug's location
- Solve
	- After locating the bug, generate a solution and test it
