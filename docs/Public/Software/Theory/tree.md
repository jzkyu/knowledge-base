A *tree* is a type of [[knowledge-base/docs/Public/Software/Theory/graph]] [[data structure]] that has a hierarchical "tree" structure. A [[knowledge-base/docs/Public/Software/Theory/root]] [[node]] "branches" off to its connected children nodes, and those nodes act as a parent node to other children nodes. You can traverse through the *tree* from the root to any node in a unique path in one direction. 

*Trees* can be used to store data that has an inherent hierarchical structure i.e. directories, files, and folders in file management systems. [^1]

*Trees* are easy to sort and search through using algorithms.
