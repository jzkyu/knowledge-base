*Machine learning* is a subfield of [[artificial intelligence]] that involves building models for computers to help make intelligence decisions.

Usually when programming, you define the rules. But it isn't always known what those rules are, as some problems can be very complex. 

*Machine learning* will identify those rules and patterns; learning a [[function]] that maps desired inputs and outputs.
