The *coefficient of determination*, or $R^2$, measures the strength of the relationship between [[independent variable]] (inputs and the [[dependent variable]] (outputs).

It indicates the goodness of the fit of a [[linear regression]].
$$
0.0 \le R^2 \le 1.0
$$
Note: $R^2$ can increase as more predictors are added to a model, which can give an illusion of improvement.
