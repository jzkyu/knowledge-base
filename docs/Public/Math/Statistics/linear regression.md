*Linear regression* is a statistical method used for modeling the relationship between a [[dependent variable]] and one or more independent variables ([[independent variable]]). 

The linear relationship is represented by the equation of a line: $y=mx+b$. 

The goal of *linear regression* is to find values of $m$ and $b$ that minimizes the difference between the predicted values and the actual values. 

The actual value ($y$) differs from the predicted value ($\hat y$) by a random amount $\epsilon$: $y = \hat y + \epsilon$
