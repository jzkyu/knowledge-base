*Correlation* measures the linear relationship between two variables ([[variable]]) $X$ and $Y$ using the Pearson correlation coefficient, the most commonly used measure of correlation for [[continuous]] variables. 

$$
\rho_{X,Y} = \frac{cov(X,Y)}{\sigma_{X}\sigma_{Y}}
$$
$$
\sigma_X=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(X_i-\bar{X}\right)^2}{n}}
$$
$$
\sigma_Y=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(Y_i-\bar{Y}\right)^2}{n}}
$$

*Correlation* measures the direction and magnitude of the linear relationship ([[linear regression]]).
