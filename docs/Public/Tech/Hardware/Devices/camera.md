A *camera* is a [[device]] that captures light and converts it into images / videos - a lens is used to focus light onto a light-sensitive surface, such as film or an electronic sensor. 

Some key components of a camera are:
- Lens: Focuses light on the sensor
- Shutter: Controls how much light reaches the sensor
- Aperture: Controls how much light the lens lets in
