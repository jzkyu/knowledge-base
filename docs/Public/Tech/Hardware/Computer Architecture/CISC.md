*CISC*, which stands for *Complex Instruction Set*, describes a [[CPU]] architecture where there are different instructions that can accomplish all sorts of tasks.

The thought process is that since hardware is so fast, we should provide instructions to do as much as we can in it so programmers can take advantage of them. 

Providing these complex instructions can increase the worse case path, which slows down all instructions.
