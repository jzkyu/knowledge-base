*CPUs* have a few different types of instruction formats to accommodate for all of the different operations while still maintaining some consistency. 

Major components of a *CPU* are:
- Program Counter: Stores the address of the instruction we are working on
- Register File: Small amount of memory inside the CPU*. Stores values we are working on
- [[ALU]]: Does the computations
- Decoder: Reads instruction and sets the control signals inside of the *CPU* to make it do what the instruction says

Some types of CPU:
- [[MIPS CPU]]
