*Memory* is the set of addressable bytes that can hold numerical values. 

There are different layers of memory:
- CPU registers: Access time is immediate
- CPU cache: A few cycles to access
- RAM / Main memory: A few hundred cycles to access
- Second level storage: A few thousands cycles to access
