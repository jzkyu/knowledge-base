*RISC*, which stands for *Reduced Instruction Set*, describes a [[CPU]] architecture where only the most commonly used instructions are used. The thought here is that programmers won't take advantage of all the special instructions, so focus on making the instructions and CPU as fast as possible. (make the common case fast)
