*Curve fitting* refers to the process of determining a [[function]] that best approximates the relationship between some [[independent variable]] and some [[dependent variable]]. 

We want to minimize the overall error. 

*Under-fitting* is when a model fails to capture the complex underlying patterns in the data
- Bias-Variance Trade off: if a model has high bias and low variance, the model under-fits the data
