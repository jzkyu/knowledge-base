*API* stands for Application Programming Interface, which is a way for computer programs to communicate with each other. 

They follow a documented [[protocol]] in how to structure the request and responses. [^1]

REST *API*, also known as Representational State Transfer, defines a set of functions to access [[server]] [[data]] using [[HTTP]] verbs. [^2] [^3]
- POST: Create a new resource into the collection of resources on the server
- GET: Retrieve resources from the server
- PUT: Update the existing resource on the server - the full resource
- PATCH: Update the existing resource on the server - portion of resource
- DELETE: Delete the resources from the server
