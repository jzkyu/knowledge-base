*Front-end* refers to the software that allows the user to use and interact with the application and its data. [^1] *Front-end* typically runs on the [[host]] computer. 

The *front-end* takes user input, and sends the needed [[request]] to the [[backend]] for [[data]]. The back-end returns with data that the *front-end* will process into something the user can use.
