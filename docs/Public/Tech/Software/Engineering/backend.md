*Back-end* refers to the software that processes data between the [[frontend]] and [[database]]. [^1]*Back-end* is generally run on the [[client]] server. 

The *back-end* will take a valid [[request]] from the [[frontend]], and request needed [[data]] from the database through [[API]] calls. The *back-end* will process and serve this data as something the *front-end* can understand and use.
