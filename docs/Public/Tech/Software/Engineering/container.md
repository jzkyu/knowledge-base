A *container* is a package that includes everything needed to run a piece of [[software]], such as the application, [[runtime]], tools, libraries, and settings. *Containers* are used to ensure software runs consistently across different environments ([[runtime environment]]). 

*Containers* are isolated, portable, and lightweight. It is important to note *containers* will share the same [[operating system]], including the [[kernel]].

A *container* engine takes a *container* image, unpacks it, and is executed on the *container* runtime.
