*See:* [[unit test]]

*Software testing* refers to the process of finding bugs in code and ensuring the program works as intended. 

Automated testing will provide the input, analyze the output, and determine if the output was correct for the given input. 

An example is the autograder for GradeScope; it is done automatically and gives you immediate feedback, but you'll have to make do with the only the information it gives you.
