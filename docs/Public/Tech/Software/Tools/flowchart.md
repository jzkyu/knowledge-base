A *flowchart* is a way to model the behavior of a program or function through buildings blocks and connections between the blocks, creating paths - a 'flow'. 

Some building blocks are:
- Process: Represents an action
- Decision: Represents a question with a finite number of answers
- Terminal: Represents the beginning or ending of a chart

Think about what the program should accomplish in terms of inputs and outputs.
