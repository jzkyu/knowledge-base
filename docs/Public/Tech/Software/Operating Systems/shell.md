A *shell* is a program that provides the text-only interface for [[Linux]] and other [[Unix]]-like operating systems. Its primary function is to read a [[command]] typed into a [[console]] or [[terminal]] window in a [[GUI]] and then execute it. [^1] It is essentially the command interpreter. [^2]

The term *shell* gets its name from being the outer layer of an [[operating system]]. A shell is an interface between the user and the internal parts of the operating system, including the [[kernel]]. [^1]
