A *directory* provides names for files. 

A *directory* consists of a group of named files or *subdirectories*. A *directory* itself is a file, which has a list of mappings from filenames to file numbers. It is only directly accessible by the [[operating system]]. 

It is a mapping from human-readable file names to file metadata locations.
