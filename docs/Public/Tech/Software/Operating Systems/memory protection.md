*Memory protection* is done by the [[operating system]] to enforce [[memory]] boundaries to a [[process]]. 

If the code tries to access unauthorized memory, it will call an [[exception]]. 

Some ways to *protect memory* are:
- Basic segmentation
	- Memory area defined by base and bound pair
- Virtual memory
	- Runtime translation between virtual and physical address spaces
