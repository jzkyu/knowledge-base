A *wrapper* is used to make writing computer programs easier by abstracting the details of the underlying implementation of a program. [^1] The *wrapper*'s main purpose is to provide a 'different' way to use the wrapped object, such as a simpler interface, or adding some functionality. [^2] 

It should simplify programs and abstract the complexity.
