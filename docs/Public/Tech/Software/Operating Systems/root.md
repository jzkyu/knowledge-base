*Root* is a user account for administrative purposes, and typically has the highest access rights on the system. [^1]

You can use `sudo` to perform actions as *root*.
- Short for "super user do"
- Actions run as root can damage your system

Some things do require *root* privileges, if they change any files in the *root*.
