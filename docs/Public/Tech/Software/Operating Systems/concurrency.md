*Concurrency* is the composition of independently executing tasks ([[task]]). 

It is different from [[sequential execution]], where tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods. 

It helps decompose complex problems into simpler ones, breaking the task into multiple processes ([[process]]).
