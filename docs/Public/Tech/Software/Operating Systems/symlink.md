A *symbolic link*, or *symlink*, is a [[file]] whose purpose is to point to (target) another file or [[directory]] with a specified [[path]]. [^1]

In a file system, a file name points to an [[inode]] containing the file's metadata. Unlike a [[hard link]], the *symlink* will point to the name of the file. [^2]
