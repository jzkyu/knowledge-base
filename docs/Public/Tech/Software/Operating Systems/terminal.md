A *terminal* is a text input and output environment. It is a program that acts as a [[wrapper]] and allows us to enter [[command]] that the computer processes. [^1]

It's the 'window' where you enter the commands your computer will process. [^1[]

The *terminal* is a program like any other, so you can download many other terminals to fit your needs. [^1]
