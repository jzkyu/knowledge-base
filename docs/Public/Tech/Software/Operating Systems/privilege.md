*Privilege* refers to the level of access to the [[hardware]] of a computer. 

It's necessary to have a separation for a few reasons:
- Security
	- To prevent unauthorized access and potential misuse of hardware devices
- Isolation
	- Keeping processes ([[process]]) from interfering with each other
- Resource management
	- To allocate hardware resources efficiently
- System Integrity
	- To ensure critical system files, configurations, and [[data]] are protected from unauthorized modifications that can jeopardize the system
