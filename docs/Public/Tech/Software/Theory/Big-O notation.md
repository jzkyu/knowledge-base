*Big-O notation* represents the upper bound of the running time of an [[algorithm]]. It gives the worst case complexity of an algorithm. [^1]

```
O(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0
            such that 0 ≤ f(n) ≤ cg(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
```

It can also be said that `g` is "at most" f.
