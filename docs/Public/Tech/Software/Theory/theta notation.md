*Theta notation* encloses the function from above and below. Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an [[algorithm]], it is used for analyzing the average case complexity of an algorithm. [^1]

```
Θ(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c1, c2 and n0
            such that 0 ≤ c1g(n) ≤ f(n) ≤ c2g(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
```
