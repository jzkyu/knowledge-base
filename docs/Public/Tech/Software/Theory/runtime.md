*Runtime* is the period of time while a program is running on a computer. 

There are different ways to describe *runtime*:
- [[Big-O notation]]
- [[small-o notation]]
- [[omega notation]]
- [[small omega notation]]
- 
Common algorithmic runtimes from fastest to slowest are: [^1]
- Constant: $O(1)$
- Logarithmic: $O(log n)$
- Linear: $O(n)$
- Polynomial: $O(n^2)$
- Exponential: $O(2^n)$
- Factorial: $O(n!)$
