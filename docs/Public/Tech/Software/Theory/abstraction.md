*Abstraction* is the principle of simplifying a complex system into a basic model. By *abstracting* the details, the new model makes it easier to work with the complex system. [^1]

A car has many systems: Brakes, transmission, suspension system, battery, etc. But we don't need to understand how each of those systems work to be able to drive a car; we just need to use the interface, i.e. the steering wheel, accelerator, and brake pedal, to use the car. We are not concerned with the inner details of the car when driving. [^1]
