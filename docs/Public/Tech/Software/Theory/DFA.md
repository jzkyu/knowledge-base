A *DFA* is a mathematical model of an idealized computational device with essentially no "[[memory]]" other than a finite [[set]] of states. 

A list of rules called transitions indicate, given the current state and symbol, what is the next state the device enters. 

Each state is labelled with a [[boolean]] output; the automaton reports a "yes" or "no" output.
