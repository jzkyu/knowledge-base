*Algorithm analysis* generally refers to the "complexity analysis" of an algorithm: how the characteristics of the [[algorithm]] changes with respect to changes in parameters.

In other words, how does the input size of an algorithm affect: [^1]
- [[runtime]] (instructional steps)
- space (in memory)
- N / W (data transferred / network consumption)
- power consumption (for battery life)
- CPU registers (physical space used on the processor)

*Algorithm analysis* is useful to measure the efficiency of an algorithm, since it is machine-independent.
