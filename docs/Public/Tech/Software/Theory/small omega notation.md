*Small omega notation* represents the lower bound of the [[runtime]] of an [[algorithm]]; the runtime will be strictly greater than small omega. It is the base case complexity of an algorithm. [^1]

```
Ω(g(n)) = { f(n): there exist positive constants c and n0 
            such that 0 ≤ cg(n) ≤ f(n) for all n ≥ n0 }
```
It can also be said that $f$ is "strictly greater than" $g$.
