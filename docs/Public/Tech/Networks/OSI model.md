*Open System Interconnection*, or *OSI*, is a model of [[abstraction]] layers in a communication system. 

There are five abstraction layers, from highest to lowest level:
1. Application Layer: High-level [[protocol]] for resource sharing (HTTP)
2. Transport Layer: Transmission of data segments between points on a [[network]] (segmentation, acknowledgements, multiplexing)
3. Network Layer: Management of a multi-node network (addressing, routing ([[router]]), traffic control)
4. Link Layer: Transmission of data frames ([[data frame]]) between two nodes ([[node]])
5. Physical Layer: Transmission of raw bit streams over a physical medium
